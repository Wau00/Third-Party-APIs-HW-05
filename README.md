# Third-Party-APIs-HW-05

# Description
Third-party APIs are a set of rules that facilitate communication between applications to exchange information or data. With third-party APIs, you can simplify the process facilitating the develop of a web page and saving a lot of time. In this project, we tested third-party APIs to run a personal scheduler with interactive functions that allow the user to record their day-to-day plan.
